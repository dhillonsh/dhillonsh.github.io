<textarea style="height: 100%; width: 50%">
 Things to note:
	- Modified client system due to limits set by xat. Only two users using a client can be on the same chat at once, due to limits set by xat. After two client users are in the chat, the client will be disabled for all other users for that chat until a spot re-opens.
 - You will not be able to perform any trades or transfers while the client is activated
	- Any thing you send or receive from any chat gets passed through me, I do not store or see any of that information because that is not my intention
	- The command code for commands is @ and any message you send starting with @ will not be sent to anybody, only you will see it.
